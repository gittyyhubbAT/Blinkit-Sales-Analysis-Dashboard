2. **Average Sales**: The average revenue per sale.
3. **Number of Items**: The total count of different items sold.
4. **Average Rating**: The average customer rating for items sold.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Microsoft Power BI**: For data visualization, interactive reporting, and dashboard development.
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning, transformation, and preliminary analysis.

## Data Processing & Modeling:
This project involved multiple stages of data processing and transformation, including:
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handled missing values, removed inconsistencies, and structured raw data for analysis.
- **Data Modeling**: Created relationships between tables using Star Schema for efficient querying.
- **DAX Calculations**: Implemented custom measures and calculated columns for in-depth sales insights (e.g., total revenue, moving averages, ranking functions).
- **Dashboard Layouting**: Designed a visually appealing and intuitive interface to enhance user experience.
- **Insights Generation**: Derived actionable insights from the data to drive business improvements.

## Key Insights & Business Recommendations:
- **Sales Trends**: Sales peak during weekends and evenings, indicating higher consumer demand. Running targeted promotions or optimizing delivery resources during peak hours can maximize revenue.
- **Outlet Performance Variability**: Larger outlets generate higher revenue but have inconsistent customer ratings, highlighting a need to improve service quality in bigger locations.
- **Regional Sales Disparities**: Some locations show high sales volumes but lower ratings, pointing to possible supply chain issues that should be addressed to improve customer experience.
- **High-Demand Product Categories**: Beverages and ready-to-eat snacks dominate sales, presenting an opportunity to expand inventory in these categories or introduce bundled offers to increase order value.
- **Optimizing Average Sales Per Order**: Outlets with higher average order values often implement discounts or loyalty programs, showing that strategic pricing and reward-based incentives can boost revenue.
